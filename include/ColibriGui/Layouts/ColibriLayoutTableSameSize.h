	/** @ingroup Layout
	@class LayoutTableSameSize
		LayoutTableSameSize can be used to specify order widgets like a table, where
		all cells are equal in size, based on the biggest cell there is.

		LayoutCell::m_proportion will be ignored

		This table works best when all cells are set LayoutCell::m_expand to true, or already
		have the same size and LayoutBase::m_softMaxSize set to zero.

		This Layout was written to serve a very specific need: Multi-column user options.

		Sometimes you want to present your users with options like this:

	@code
		.
			Option A	Option D
			Option B	Option E
			Option C
	@endcode

		This can be easily achieved by any means, except when you get problems like the following:

	@code
		.
			Option A	Option D
			Option B	Very Long Multiline
			Option C		option E
	@endcode

		Therefore this Layout will enlarge all options so they are evenly spaced again:

	@code
		.
				Option A				Option D

				Option B			Very Long Multiline
										option E
				Option C
	@endcode

		That's all there is to it. Do not think too hard of this Layout, it serves a very
		specific need. If it doesn't get it to look the way you want, it's not your fault,
		and use a different one.

	@remarks
		Many of the variables are public, because once you're done modifying them all you should
		call LayoutTableSameSize::layout()<br/>
		Thus there are few or no setter / getters.
