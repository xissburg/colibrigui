		Multiline version of LayoutLine.
		LayoutLine can be used to implement a table, but it does not guarantee all columns will align
		if you're careless.
		LayoutMultiline guarantees all the columns will align

		For that purpose, LayoutMultiline assumes:
			1. The LayoutCell::m_proportion values from the cells in the first row are considered.
			   All other rows' m_proportion are ignored.
	@remarks
		Many of the variables are public, because once you're done modifying them all you should
		call LayoutMultiline::layout()<br/>
		Thus there are few or no setter / getters.
