	@class LayoutCell
		Base class that can be used by the Layout system to place and size cells around.
		Derived class must implement several functions that will be called by the Layout system.

		Layout cells are used by other layout systems like LayoutLine.

	@remarks
		Many of the variables are public, because once you're done modifying them all you should
		call (e.g.) LayoutLine::layout()

		Many of the variables are arrays two, i.e. m_proportion[2]. One entry for each axis.
		i.e. m_proportion[0] refers to .x (horizontal) and m_proportion[1] to .y (vertical)

		/// Example: LayoutLine is used, with horizontal layout,
		/// thus all cells are layed out in a row
		///
		///		* We have 4 cells and the maximum width is 1000
		///		* If all cells in an entry have m_proportion = 1, then the each cell
		///		  will be width = 250
		///		* If one of those cells had m_proportion = 2 instead, then 3 cells
		///		  would have width = 200 and 1 cell would have width = 400
		///		  This is because the total proportion is 5 (1+1+1+2=5) and
		///		  then the proportions would be 1/5 1/5 1/5 2/5
